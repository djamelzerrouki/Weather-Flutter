# Getting Started

This project is a Flutter app that helps find images via the Pixabay API. It provides API on the RESTful interface to find and restore free photos and videos released under the Pixabay license. The API displays encrypted JSON objects.
I used this API to display beautifully designed images on mobile (Android and iOS), while developing a mobile cross-platform with a simple flutter code.

Some resources to get started with such a Flutter project:
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
- [Data & backend](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/networking)
- [Networking](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/networking)
- [JSON and serialization](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/json)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
